# tableaunoir

**Tableaunoir is an online blackboard tool**.
It can be used as a traditional blackboard but you can also create interactive animations via the use of "fridge magnets".
"Tableau noir" means blackboard in french.

The online version is available here: [tableaunoir.github.io](https://tableaunoir.github.io/)
(another instance is here: http://tableaunoir.irisa.fr)


## Example of use

Tableaunoir is used for teaching at [ENS Rennes](https://dit.ens-rennes.fr/). You are free to use it for your own teaching!
The main advantage is that the screen is fully black: there are no buttons that annoy the students.
Tableaunoir is controlled by a graphic tablet and by the keyboard of the computer (7 keys!).

It makes it very interactive compared to fixed slides. See by yourself:

## Features

* Of course, you can draw and erase.
* You can also use kind of predefined fridge magnets that you can move on the board, to make animation e.g. for illustrating sorting algorithms, etc.
* Create your own customized "fridge magnets" for interactive courses (drag & drop an image in any format!).
* Color palette for chalk.
* Divide vertically the screen in two.
* Change the color of magnets' background.
* Save the current board for future use.
* Load a board.
* Switch back and forth between whiteboard and blackboard.
* Create a new panel on the right, and move left/right.

You can teach online by sharing the screen with Discord, Zoom, Teams, etc.
